Single Variable Linear Regression Using Gradient Descent
          - By Anshuman Das Gupta
*******************************************************************

This is an octave/MATLAB program for predicting the profit of a Food
Truck based on the population of a city. 
It uses single variable regression with gradient descent to find the
hypothesis for predicting the values of profit according to the 
population.
Multiple graphs have been plotted to demonstrate the relationship 
between population and profit , cost function over time , and the
curve which is our hypothesis.

NOTE - Feature normalisation has been done , which is not required
for single variable linear regression but will not have any impact 
on the result.
